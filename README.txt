This program uses python3 with pandas to calculate measure scores from a csv data file.

The solution is contained in the MeasureScoreAnalyzer directory. It is run as:
python3 Main.py MEASURE_SCORE (optional)DATAFILE

examples:
python3 Main.py AMI
python3 Main.py COPD SampleData2016.csv

The GrayMatterWrangling.ipynb file contains an ipython notebook which documents my approach to build this program as a stream of consciousness. It includes initial data wrangling, debugging, issues seen, multiple approaches, and initial versions of the functions ultimately used to solve this problem.
